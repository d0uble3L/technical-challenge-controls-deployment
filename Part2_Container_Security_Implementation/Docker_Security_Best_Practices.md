# Docker Security Best Practices

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Official Images

- **Description:** Always use official and verified images from trusted sources to ensure the integrity and security of the container images.
- **Implementation:** When pulling images, prefer images from official repositories or those that are verified.

### 2. Minimize Image Size

- **Description:** Use minimal base images to reduce the attack surface and potential vulnerabilities.
- **Implementation:** Choose lightweight base images like `alpine` and only include necessary dependencies.

### 3. Run as Non-Root User

- **Description:** Avoid running containers as the root user to minimize the risk of privilege escalation attacks.
- **Implementation:** Define a non-root user in the Dockerfile using the `USER` directive.

### 4. Enable Docker Content Trust (DCT)

- **Description:** Use Docker Content Trust to ensure the integrity and authenticity of images.
- **Implementation:** Enable DCT by setting the `DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST` environment variable to `1`.

### 5. Regularly Scan Images

- **Description:** Use tools like Docker Bench for Security to scan images for vulnerabilities and ensure they are free from known security issues.
- **Implementation:** Integrate image scanning into your CI/CD pipeline to automate vulnerability detection.

## Implementation Example

Here is an example Dockerfile implementing one of these best practices by running the container as a non-root user:

```dockerfile
# Use minimal base image
FROM alpine:3.12

# Add a non-root user and set the user
RUN addgroup -S appgroup && adduser -S appuser -G appgroup
USER appuser

# Application setup
WORKDIR /app
COPY . /app

# Start the application
CMD ["sh", "-c", "echo Hello, World!"]
