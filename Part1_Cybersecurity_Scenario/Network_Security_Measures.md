# Network Security Measures

## Overview

To enhance the organization's defense posture and prevent future security breaches, the following network security measures are recommended.

## Recommended Measures

### 1. Intrusion Detection/Prevention System (IDS/IPS)

- Deploy IDS/IPS to monitor network traffic for suspicious activity.
- Configure IDS/IPS to block malicious traffic and alert security personnel.

### 2. Firewalls

- Implement network firewalls to control inbound and outbound traffic based on predefined security policies.
- Regularly update firewall rules to address emerging threats.

### 3. Network Segmentation

- Segment the network into different zones (e.g., DMZ, internal network) to limit the spread of attacks.
- Implement strict access controls between segments to ensure only authorized traffic is allowed.

### 4. VPNs and Secure Connections

- Use VPNs to secure remote access to the network.
- Ensure all connections to sensitive resources are encrypted.

### 5. Network Access Control (NAC)

- Implement NAC to enforce security policies on devices connecting to the network.
- Use NAC to ensure that only compliant and authorized devices are granted access.

### Conclusion

Implementing these network security measures will enhance the organization's defense posture, reduce the risk of breaches, and protect sensitive data and resources.
